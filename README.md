It's a website.

## Dev

This site is built on [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a static site generator for React.

To install and start the dev server:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

If all goes well the dev version should now be available at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Fonts, images, and videos, are `gitignored`, sorry about that.
